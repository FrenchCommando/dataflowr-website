# Deep Learning Do It Yourself!

\blurb{
    This site collects resources to learn Deep Learning in the form of
    Modules available through the sidebar on the left.
    As a student, you can walk through the modules at your own pace and
    interact with others thanks to the associated
    [digital platforms](#social-interactions).
    Then we hope you'll become a [contributor](#for_contributors)
    by adding modules to this site!
